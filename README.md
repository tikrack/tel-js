## How to install?
This package is very easy to use, you just need to install it first.

```
npm i tel-js
```

Then you need to add it to your project. Like below:

```html
<script type="module">
    import TelJs from "tel-js";
    // other codes ...
</script>
```

The above method is for the case where you are using construction tools like Vite. And if you are not using them, you can proceed with the following methods:

```html
<script type="module">
    import TelJs from "./node_modules/tel-js/index.js";
    // other codes ...
</script>
```

Or if you don't want to install anything, you can use CDNs like below:

```html
<script type="module">
  import TelJS from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tel-js@latest/index.js';
</script>
```

## How to use?
Let's get to how to use it
We need some information before using it.
You first need to create a bot in Telegram in the @BotFather bot and have its token.
Then you need to add it to a group or channel and get the chat_id of that group or channel or even a conversation and have it too. (For more information on this, you can refer to the Telegram documentation)
Finally, you need to have the token and chat ID as follows:

```
token => "7625382592:AAdX0jkcydTx7NG2e2X3zkUvnOMmh5DeS9s"
chat_id => "-1302142270666"
```

If you've made it this far, congratulations, because you've completed 80% of the steps ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ðŸš€

## last stage ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
Here you need to create an instance of the class you imported and then give it 
first token 
and second chat_id 
as props respectively.

```html
<script type="module">
  import TelJS from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tel-js@latest/index.js";

  // new TelJS(token, chat_i)
  const telegram = new TelJS(
    "7625185562:AAGX0jfcydTx7NG2erX3zkUvnOMmK5DeS9s", // token
    "-3002192470356" // chat_id
  );
</script>
```

In this way, you have done the initial configuration very correctly. Now let's move on to the message sending stage.
To do this, simply call a function called send on the instance of the class you created with the input of your desired message:

```html
<script type="module">
  import TelJS from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tel-js@latest/index.js";

  // new TelJS(token, chat_i)
  const telegram = new TelJS(
    "7625185562:AAGX0jfcydTx7NG2erX3zkUvnOMmK5DeS9s", // token
    "-3002192470356" // chat_id
  );

  telegram.send("test message").then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
  });
</script>
```

That's it
Also, the result variable is the output of the API and your text should be in the props of the send function.
Another point is that the parse-HTML feature is also enabled and you can use it in your messages
For example:

```javascript
telegram.send("<b>Hello</b>").then((result) => {
    console.log(result);
});
```

Done.ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
Also, if you have any problems running the package, you can let me know in the issues section.
