## How to use?
This package is very easy to use, you just need to install it first.

```
npm i tel-js
```

Then you need to add it to your project. Like below:

```html
<script type="module">
    import TelJs from "tel-js";
    // other codes ...
</script>
```

The above method is for the case where you are using construction tools like Vite. And if you are not using them, you can proceed with the following methods:

```html
<script type="module">
    import TelJs from "./node_modules/tel-js/index.js";
    // other codes ...
</script>
```

Or if you don't want to install anything, you can use CDNs like below:

```html
<script type="module">
  import TelJS from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tel-js@latest/index.js';
</script>
```
